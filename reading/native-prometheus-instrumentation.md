Such a good discussion about the duties and goals of OpenTelemetry and other competitors. Its easy to notice that the Otel performance is worse than instrument your code using native SDKs. And other downgrades that appears when you are not using the original tool to instrument your code.

Than, the questions that remains, why OTEL is useful? If we are generating systems that consume more memory and are more inneficient it means that the original ideia can be thrown away?
