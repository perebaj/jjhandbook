# About the book itself

Now, that I'm finished reading the first chapter, which is directed to summarize the principal philosophers of the last century, one thing that I didn't like too much about the book, is that don't exist references, I don't know where I can confirm the information or who wrote about each guy.

# Philosophy

In this section, I was presented with a lot of philosophers' stories, someones pleased me more, but I will try to exemplify what most of them were trying to reach, starting from 348 a.C with Plato and ending with Alber Camus, 1960.

I feel that I can resume their philosophy in five principles:

- What is life and how can I achieve happiness;
- Think more, is the only way to deal with life
- Love
- Religion
- The importance of the Art

One thing that I perceived from reading the biography of these philosophers, is that the major of them comes from rich families and they had, depending on the epoch that they live, important roles in politics, that way, make sense how your ideas were spread across in an epoch that the communication was limited

### Plato

This guy dedicates his life to explaining and helping people to achieve a "spiritual state" that he calls eudaimonia, this word in grek could mean happiness or satisfaction, in his theory, happiness suggests a continuous behavior, while satisfaction is more compatible with periods of pain and suffering that everyone is susceptible to fell.

How did Plato propose to make people more satisfied? He builds four principles:

Think More:
Love more wisely:
The importance of beauty:
Changing the society:

### Georg Hegel

Despite Hegel not being considered a comprehensive philosopher, I like your ideas, which could be summarized as:

**Believe in history:****

Progress is never linear, exist wisdom in all processes, this doesn't mean that it's not possible to absorb important lessons from terrible epoches in human history, is the duty of historians, to rescue the most necessary ideas and compare to the present

**Learn with ideas that you don't like:**

Here, he gives a nationalist example, which is a behavior neglected(at least in Brasil), but he thinks that the most important ideas could be in the hands of people that we consider unworthy and even despise, it's a task that good thinkers should keep in mind.

**The progress is confusing:**

the painful path, from error to error, is inevitable, the revolution is constructed under the two principles that I mentioned above, which could be summarized as `dialectic`. Exists wisdom in all people and epochs!

**We need institutions:*

Here, he argues that important ideas were only diffused because it's was surrounded by important institutions, he gives some examples, about religion and church, Freud, and Tavistock Clinics in London, but in the end, the principal is, the most incredible ideas don't spread across and have the right diffusion, if it not was supported by renowned institutions.

### Friedrich Nietzsche

Aos olhos de Nietzche, e religião de alguma forma, abrandava a sensações naturais dos seres humanos, como a inveja, sexo, fraqueza, submissão tornando-as sinonimos de virtudes quando controladas. Por esse motivo, que ele possuia algumas fortes opiniões sobre a real necessidade da religião, que em sua opinião, afastava das pessoas, o pensamento crítico, tentando subvertelas a um processo 


## Adam Smith 1723 – 17 July 1790

I notice that the philosophers in the 17 century starts to pay more attentions around topics that involve the capitalism itself and your relation with the human beeing, and one interesting topic that Adam brings that I
