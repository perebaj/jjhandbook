> 🕶 Pubsub emulator for local environment
>
> Have a local environment that it's trustworthy and looks like with your cloud environment is the pure fucking gold. Please spend more time doing that


> 👍 Push -> Pull
> 
> ## Issues with using push
> - Data consumption settings in *push* are implemented by default, so it's not possible to control the amount/velocity 🏃🏽‍♀️ 💨 of data that arrives at our services.
>   * We are susceptible to a self-DDoS attack 🧲
>   * *push* is preferred for applications that consume messages using serverless computing. 😶‍🌫️
>   * Impact on other services that are not related to data consumption. For example, search operations in the application.
> - *Push* subscriptions require routes exposed to the internet 🌐
>    * We have to manage the entire network infrastructure to perform this "exposure," including: Ingress, HTTPS Certificates & LoadBalancer 😮‍💨
> - Since we're constantly loading, enriching, and saving data, it's ideal to do fewer operations with more data to spare effort for our databases, rather than the opposite. Few operations with little data. 🤏🏽🤌🏽




> 🌻Handbook documentation
>
> "What if the most important part of "platform engineering" is maintaining a high quality wiki with proven, empathic patterns for Stream-aligned teams to follow?" - Matthew Skelton


> 🤡 Instrumentation/Metrics for a puller using Prometheus
> 
> This instrumentation involves simple metrics such as verifying the amount of time that each message takes to process and how many messages are processed per second. The difference that made an improvement in our metrics was choosing the right labels, such as:
> - Subscription name (to easily find the topic and see our status);
> - Delivery attempt (the last delivery attempt indicates that there are problems occurring);
> - If the message was ack or nack (status of messages);
> - Consumer type (which part of the code is processing this message?)


> 🫁 Pubsub alert policy
> 
> Alerts like:
> - alert policy to monitor the oldest unacknowledged message in the system.
> - alert policy to monitor the number of dead letter messages in the system.



> 👻 [Workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) in Kubernetes cluster
> 
> Avoiding storing passwords in containers or saving them as plaintext in a Git repository is not a good practice. For this reason, when deploying on a Kubernetes cluster, GKE allows for the association of a service account with Kubernetes workloads without the need for messy configurations.

> 🥷 Elastic query history
>
> It can be a challenging task to identify problems when you have no idea how to find them. We have > encountered numerous issues with Elastic disruption, and creating mechanisms to trace expensive  
> queries in our system is an essential task, especially when it comes to Elastic search, which is > our primary database. Even when using a managed database, slow query tracking is not always a >default feature. That is why we have enabled the [slow query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-slowlog.html#index-modules-slowlog) log to help us >identify and address these issues.
> 


> 😬 Dont treat exceptions in a generic way can cause disruption in your code
> 
> Errors make the process die, for this reason, it's essential to treat exceptions to exhibit the error and not finish the program. I figured out this problem because the database wasn't accepting requests, the code broke and didn't accept data at all. In python, just put in the main loop a try/except handler. Error fixed


> 👣 Instrumentatate elastic/opensearch client to get performance evaluation for all queries 
>
> Instrumentation is a task that not only depends on the tool you are using, but also on the design of your code, as it ultimately determines how easy the implementation will be. In this particular case, there is no magic involved - we simply wrapped the opensearch/elk client, and tracked metrics such as feedback_search_query_total and feedback_search_query_duration_seconds.
> 
> The feedback_search_query_total metric tracks the total number of queries made to Elastic Search, counting them by consumer type and query type. On the other hand, the feedback_search_query_duration_seconds metric is a histogram used to measure the duration in seconds of interactions between the code and Elastic Search, grouped by consumer type and query type.
> 
> Choosing the right labels is crucial, as they facilitate filtering in dashboards and enable more effective monitoring of the system.


> 👘 Getting ID token by impersonating a svc-account for local environment
>
>Using svc-accounts as JSON files can be problematic, as it can be difficult to keep track of how many accounts are being used and where they are located. This approach can also be unsafe and may lead to issues such as multiple accounts being used for the same Docker image, with overlapping roles and responsibilities. To address these problems, we spent time working on a solution that synchronizes user accounts to a svc-account with the same roles and permissions as the service deployed in the cloud (staging). This means that developers can simply authenticate and start working without having to share JSON files, while the infrastructure team can maintain better control over who has access to what. This approach helps to prevent incidents and ensures that every user has appropriate access to the necessary resources, specially when developers are trying to access APIS from others teams.

## Q1 2023 Resume
In this quarter we brought a new senior member to the infrastructure team and we focus on improve the backlog  that we don't made in the past and besides that, improve all infrastucture in general, like, instrumenting our applications, automanting all things related to k8s/cloud/infra all of that using terraform. But I think I can sum it up, saying that the better that we do, was spread patters betweens all aplications/teams of the company. While every was focused in develop new features, we are foucused on better the Birdie system.

## Leasons
- Work with people who inspire you.
- Being a senior doesn't mean doing the same thing for many years; it means being prepared to solve and help with technical problems.
- Instrumentation, metrics, logging, and alerts are essential components of any serious system. Experienced and serious engineers know how to implement these effectively.  
- Even though I have chosen to stay in this role this quarter, I do not enjoy it. I want to be a complete software designer(because of that I put myself in this position), but focus on solve problems that teams don't wanna give a fuck, it's not a thing that I like
- Python it's not a good option for serious distributed systems, enterprises, all...


# Quarte 2 2023

* 😍 Golang cmd adpter for the extractor service



---


> 😍 The Golang cmd adapter is designed to simplify the debugging of the Extractor service. The Extractor service is responsible for extracting information from a set of feedback, such as the type, sentiment, and intention for each segment of text.
> 
>     🫣 The adapter is intended to read a CSV file and generate a summary of the service's performance.
